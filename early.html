    <p><i>Mohammad Rizwan's path to international cricket was a testament to perseverance, transitioning from table tennis in his youth to tape-ball cricket on the streets of Peshawar, where his fearless diving earned him the nickname "Jonty." Despite initial family opposition who prioritized his education, Rizwan pursued cricket with dedication, making his professional debut in 2008 for the Peshawar Panthers. A pivotal moment in his career came around 2012 when he was recruited by the domestic powerhouse Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). His strong performance, including a key double-century in the 2014-15 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final, made him a standout player in the domestic circuit. This consistent grind over seven years finally paid off following the 2015 World Cup, leading to his selection for the national squad. He made a strong impression in his One Day International (ODI) debut on April 17, 2015, against Bangladesh in Dhaka, where he scored 67 runs off 58 balls, quickly followed by his T20I debut later that month, and his Test debut the following year.</i></p>
