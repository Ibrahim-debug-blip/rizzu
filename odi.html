    <p><i>Mohammad Rizwan has maintained a solid One Day International (ODI) career for the Pakistan cricket team, known for his ability to adapt his batting style to different match situations and his reliable wicketkeeping. As of November 2025, he has appeared in exactly 100 ODI matches, accumulating a total of 2,921 runs from 91 innings. His statistics in the 50-over format include a commendable average of 41.73 and a strike rate of 85.01, featuring four centuries and 19 half-centuries. Behind the stumps, he has been effective with 111 catches and 7 stumpings. A standout performance in his career was his unbeaten 131 against Sri Lanka during the 2023 World Cup, which remains his highest score and the highest score by a Pakistani captain in a successful ODI run chase. He also had a brief stint as captain, leading the team in 20 ODIs.</i></p>
