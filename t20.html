    <h1><strong><mark>T20i career of Muhammad Rizwan</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Mohammad Rizwan has built an impressive T20I career with the Pakistan cricket team, known for his consistency as a wicketkeeper-batsman and his skill in anchoring innings. As of late 2025, he has played in 106 T20I matches and scored a total of 3,414 runs in 93 innings. His statistics boast an impressive average of 47.42 and a strike rate of 125.38, including one century (a top score of 104 not out) and 30 half-centuries. Beyond his batting prowess, he has also been reliable behind the stumps, taking 55 catches and effecting 12 stumpings. A highlight of his career came in 2021 when he was named the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year after setting a world record for the most T20I runs in a single calendar year with 1,326 runs. He further distinguished himself by becoming the fastest Asian player to reach 3,000 T20I runs and one of the few Pakistani players to score a century in all three international formats.
